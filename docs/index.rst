Welcome to Interface For Research Opportunities's documentation!
================================================================
The Interface For Research Opportunities (IRO) application is designed to simplify and improve the
administration of primarily Research Experience For Undergraduates (REU) programs, although should be flexible enough
for similar programs as well. This is a project of the Summer Program For Undergraduate Research (SPUR) of the
Institute of Neuroscience at the University of Oregon.
