Authentication
==============

The IRO utility uses five different levels of authentication by default. There are the Admins, or superusers, with access
to every part of the utility; Faculty, who have access to Faculty pages and some Intern and Mentor information; Mentors,
who have access to Mentor pages and some Intern and Faculty information; Interns, who have access to Intern information,
and anonymous users, who only have access to the public aspects of the utility and website, such as the Application page.
