# REU Utility
A utility to make REU (Research Experiences For Undergraduates) administration easier.

Built on Django, this implementation of the original REU utility, located here: https://github.com/sarahyablok/reu-utility, uses only open-source and free software
by default. 

# TODO
Forms, setup page, some encryption(i.e. SSN)
